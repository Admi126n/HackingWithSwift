# iTour

App in which you can save your travelling plans, including travel destination, priority, date and things that you want to see.

#### Project created during this course: [Swift Data by Paul Hudson](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuoeXyslFTuZ9Nag8qTVz5wQ7zRprxMxN)

#### Challanges for this project:
- Add swipe delete to individual sights
- Use array of sort descriptors to initialise DestinationListView. First one should be user choice, the second one is sensible alternative (user chosen priority so the second one is name)
- Add second picker to the toolbar in the content view. It should decide if user see all destinations or only those from the future.
